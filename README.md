Tokenization is the process of breaking a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words, phrases, or other meaningful units of text. Tokenization is an important step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as it allows the text to be more easily analyzed and processed.

A positional index is a type of index in which the position of a token in a document is recorded in the index. This can be useful for tasks such as information retrieval, where the position of a token in a document may be relevant to the search query.

For example, consider a document with the following text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." If we tokenize this text, we would get a list of tokens such as ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]. If we then create a positional index for this document, the index would include the position of each token in the document. So, for example, the index might include entries such as "quick: 2", which indicates that the token "quick" appears in the second position in the document.

Positional indexes can be useful for tasks such as information retrieval, because they allow us to easily find all occurrences of a token in a document and understand their context within the document. They can also be useful for tasks such as text summarization, where the position of a token within a document may be relevant to its importance or relevance.
